It is denoted by a suffix to the item's name, such as *+1*, *+2*, and so on.\n\nFor each level of item quality, the item will gain a multiplicative 10% bonus to most of its effects. So, for example, while a normal Longsword gives +30:attack:, a Longsword +1 will give +33:attack:, and a Longsword +10 would give +78:attack:. It will also gain a multiplicative 50% bonus to its sale price.\n      \nYou can combine three identical pieces of equipment (including pouch items) to obtain one piece with one level higher item quality. For example, you can combine three Longsword +1 to obtain a Longsword +2.\n\nWhile higher level items are usually stronger than lower level items, item quality can drastically change this. *Do not underestimate low-level items* - if you can Transmute them easily, you will be able to obtain a piece with much higher item quality, and in some cases it will be worth it!",

  ":retirement:**Retirement** is one of the most powerful features in the game. In essence, retiring allows you to restart the game from the beginning, including choosing a new primary Element. However, there are strong benefits to retirement which are detailed below.\n    \nWhen you retire, the level your primary Element is currently at is permanently recorded. This level is called the **Maximum Primary Level**, or **MPL**. The MPL for an Element can never go down - if you re-select an Element as your primary and then retire again without reaching your previous MPL, you will keep the previous value.\n\nAfter you retire, you will get a **Global Experience Multiplier**. This multiplier is very important, as it can vastly improve the effectiveness of studying, letting you unlock stronger spells much, much quicker.\n\nIn addition, there is a similar **Global Production Multiplier** which will affect all resource production you have from Channeling, furniture and other features in the game. This includes Mana, which means after retirement it should be much easier to cast stronger spells or cast spells more often. This also affects loot.\n\nBoth of the multipliers above are determined based on two factors. The first is the maximum MPL you have ever achieved, regardless of Element. This is the main factor impacting the two multipliers. The second is the sum of all the MPLs you have across all the Elements. This is a secondary factor and it will impact the multipliers, but not as much. Because of this, it's recommended to **pick a new Primary Element when retiring** if possible, to maximize the bonuses.\n\nOne last benefit from retirement is related to Storylines. Any **benefits acquired from Storylines will persist through retirements**, meaning progress will become faster. In addition, some Storylines only provide their benefit after you retire once - retiring is encouraged in order to get the full benefit in those cases.\n\nDeciding when to retire is very important. One suggestion is to retire if progress has gotten slower or achieving the next Goal (see: **Home** help section) appears impossible. Another is to retire if the research and production multipliers will substantially increase, or if you complete a Storyline with powerful effects that only appear after retirement. For the first retirement *only*, it is usually a good idea to retire if your new Global Experience Multiplier will be above 2.5x (i.e. do not retire right away after unlocking Retirement).": ":retirement:**Retirement** is one of the most powerful features in the game.

More variety in items and spells, with large amounts of synergies. And, of course - wrapping all of that with a new story.\n\nOf course, the prototype grew and grew.

You finally feel *happiness*.\n\nThe World is brighter than ever.": "Yelling, you strike at Satell one last time, interrupting his Wide Big Bang! Exhausted, this time, the Divine no longer tries again. Instead, he appears to stumble - and drops the Philosopher's Stone!\n      \nYou get ready to hit him again, but you're stopped by a flash of light. A second Divine appears next to him; the same one that had helped you before.\n\n*\"You did it; out of your own strength. We have been watching\"*, they say with a strong voice. *\"Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you are worthy of the Stone.\"* The Divine then lays one of their hands on Satell's shoulder. With another bright flash of light, both Divines disappear, leaving behind only the quiet sound of the wildlife around you.\n\nYou take a deep breath. Did you really win...? You look around you. The place is dark and quiet. Your companions are still alert. And in front of you... it's the *Philosopher's Stone*. You approach it, take a deep breath, and hold the Stone once more...\n\nDespite its overwhelming power, you are able to stay calm, in control. You nod at your travel companions...\n\n*\"YES! You did it!\"* Ecstatic, your hired wizard finally lets her guard down, and shows you a wide smile you haven't seen in a long while.\n\nThe Headmaster approaches you. \"The Divines are c-correct. I cannot imagine anyone else who could be more fit for that Philosopher's Stone. V-Very well - you can keep it. *But...*\" He leans closer, and whispers something on your ear. Then, leaning back, he simply says: *\"P-Please.\"* You look at him, and nod.\n\nBack at your home, you lay the Philosopher's Stone on your desk, making sure nobody can trace its location. You sit down, and begin to work on devising a cure for the disease.\n\nDays of work turn into weeks, and then into months... The work feels *nearly endless*. Until, suddenly, one day, you manage to connect all the dots together, making practical recipes for not just one, but *two* items. The first one is the *serum* to heal the disease, regardless of how advanced its progress is. And the second one is a *vaccine* to prevent the disease, so it will never be able to take hold in the first place!\n\nProud of your end result, you put it into practice right away.
